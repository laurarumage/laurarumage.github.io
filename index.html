<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<p>"An underbite is the projection of the lower teeth beyond the upper. " <br />

<p>In the case of <em>Digby's</em> underbite, his teeth do not even fit inside his face.</p>

This site has both good and bad qualities.
Good: The author is talking about dogs, and dogs are wonderful.
Bad: I think the page's main navigation should have been contained in a semantic <nav> tag. The navigation is actually setup as a table. In researching where the navigation table begins, I also determined that the entire visible webpage is contained within a table! It is interesting to still see a website with table layout while tableless design is widely favored. Tables were never intended as a layout toolâ€”tables were intended for the display of tabular data!
(LOOK AT <OL> AND MAKE SURE IN PLACE FOR BODY CONTENT LIST, LOOK AT PADDING/WHATEVER IS CAUSING <OL> NUMBERS TO BUTT INTO THE IMAGE)
