  <h1>Related Website Observations</h1>
<p>I chose a <a href="http://thebark.com/content/things-i-love-about-my-dog" target="_blank">similar web page from The Bark</a>, a dog magazine. The page is an article listing things the author loves about her dog.</p>

<p>This page has both good and bad qualities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Good:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>The author is talking about dogs, and dogs are wonderful.</li>
    <li>The ordered list on the page is set up properly with a list tag, specifically &#60ol&#62.</li>
    <li>Each item on the ordered list mentioned above is created as a distinct list item using the semantic tag &#60li&#62.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Bad:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>I think the page's main navigation should have been contained in a semantic &#60nav&#62 tag. The navigation is actually setup as a table.</li>
    <li>In researching where the navigation table mentioned above begins, I also determined that the entire visible web page is contained within a table! It is interesting to still see a website with table layout while table-less design is widely favored these days. Tables were never intended as a layout tool--tables were intended for the display of tabular data!</li>
    <li>The article does not use header tags to semantically define header content. What should be created as the &#60h1&#62 tag has been created as a div with a class assignment to provide meaning.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
<p>Overall, there are some areas that this web page could improve, namely in the area of including more semantic tags to provide additional meaning to the content.</p>
